        <hr>
              <br>
<p> I felt the thrill of sports for the first time when I was 12 years old and my father took me to the stadium to watch a football match, 
  and this was the moment that has driven my life choices. The next step for me was to join the local football team and my passion for sport kept growing.
  After high school, I studied business management at college as I thought that this is what you need for success in life. Successfully graduating and working 
  in a variety of business environments for the following five years I could not find satisfaction in it. A few years later, in 2017, knowing that my passion lay
   in sports, I completed a Master's degree in Conditioning Training. During this course, I met many experts who inspired me. I have worked with football teams in
    Portugal and Croatia where I attended seminars with some of the best professors in the field. Today I see health through sport as a necessity
   in everyoneâ€™s life and constantly seek to increase my knowledge of sports science in relation to our body and mind.</p>

                  I didnâ€™t feel confident in the water and Stoil has helped me to overcome that.
                  Now I am a lot more confident and calm in the water.

                  One of the most valuable lessons I have learned from him is what not to do, because not every exercise is good for my health.
