        <p>  The human body is it created for movement externally and internally, and our muscles are continuously active.
           When we’re sedentary, sitting at a desk, or eating, our muscles are still working for us, even when we are sleeping! Of course,
            they’re more active when we’re walking or doing physical tasks, but sometimes that is not enough to maintain good condition. When we reach adulthood,
             we have already developed muscles to perform a larger variety of movements needed in our daily lives. In cases where healthy habits have not been established 
             since childhood, it is much more difficult to motivate a person to start 
          thinking about their body as their “temple” in adulthood. Many people only consider doing this when they are faced with health problems.

                    The lessons were challenging at first as it was a completely new experience for me.
                    I didn’t feel confident in the water and Stoil has helped me to overcome that.
                    Now I am a lot more confident and calm in the water.
                    I believe that going through this challenge has also increased my general self confidence in life.</p>

                  <p class="testimonial">My name is Pavlin and I am Stoil’s brother.
                    As a big brother he has always tried to set me a good example.
                    He has passed on his love of sport to me.
                    Over the years I have learned a lot of different exercises and how to correctly perform them as well as techniques to recover from injuries. 
                    One of the most valuable lessons I have learned from him is what not to do, because not every exercise is good for my health.

                    The water aerobics classes with Stoil were great! We had a lot of fun and positive emotions in the water and it has always been a good and challenging workout.

                    He put a lot of effort into preparing for each session by setting a new combination of exercises each time and making sure that I progress towards my goals.
